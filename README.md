## Featured Projects  

### Autonomous Driving Traffic Sign Recognition  
Custom CNN + YOLOv8 pipeline for multi-class traffic sign recognition using self-annotated datasets.

### Sharpe-Optimized Stock Return Prediction  
20-year financial dataset, technical indicator engineering, Ridge/XGBoost models, and Sharpe ratio–based evaluation.

### Distributed Movie Recommender System (PySpark + ALS)  
1M+ interactions processed with a full PySpark pipeline; optimized ALS model improving RMSE from 1.05 → 0.89.

### Job Market Skill Clustering (NLP + Visualization)  
4,000+ job postings analyzed with TF-IDF, KMeans, and hierarchical clustering to discover role-based skill groups.

### Sentiment Analysis with RNN / GRU / LSTM  
Preprocessed 50,000 IMDB reviews and built multiple deep learning models to evaluate sequence modeling performance.

### Azure Stream Analytics & ML Pipeline  
End-to-end IoT data ingestion → Stream Analytics → Data Factory → Azure ML classification workflow.
